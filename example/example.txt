Section 1 - Format an indented paragraph

    Selecting this entire paragraph in VISUAL mode and typing 'gq' should not affect its
    indentation. Same thing with typing 'gwip' in NORMAL mode with the cursor anywhere in
    the paragraph.

Section 2 - Format an indented list that breaks across lines:

    -   Same as above, selecting all of these bullets and hitting 'gq' should not do
        anything at all
    -   All of them should stay the same
    -   Even this one

Section 3 - Bulleted lists

    -   Cursor anywhere. Type 'o'. Cursor should be at col 5 of next line.
    *   Cursor anywhere. Type '<Enter>'. Cursor should be at col 9 of next line.
    >   Cursor at end of line. Starting typing. Text should wrap to col 9 with no >.
    +   '+' is not a comment leader. <Enter> and typing should both wrap to col 5.

Section 4 - Numbered lists

    Same behavior as Section 3

    1.  Cursor at end of line. Type 'o'. Cursor should be at col 5 of next line.
    2.  Cursor at end of line. Type '<Enter>'. Cursor, sadly, doesn't go to column 9. But
    selecting this text and hitting 'gq' fixes it (same with 'gwip').
    3.  Cursor at end of line. Starting typing. Text should wrap to col 9 with no number.
